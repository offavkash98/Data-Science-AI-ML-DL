    "### **1. Supervised Learning**  \n",
    "**Definition**: Learns from **labeled data** (input-output pairs) to predict outcomes for new data.  \n",
    "**Types**:  \n",
    "- **Classification** (Discrete output): Spam detection, image recognition.  \n",
    "  *Algorithms*: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.  \n",
    "- **Regression** (Continuous output): House price prediction, weather forecasting.  \n",
    "  *Algorithms*: Linear Regression, Decision Trees.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- Input: Email content â†’ Output: \"Spam\" or \"Not Spam\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Unsupervised Learning**  \n",
    "**Definition**: Finds patterns in **unlabeled data** (no predefined output).  \n",
    "**Types**:  \n",
    "- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points.  \n",
    "  *Algorithms*: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering.  \n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing features while preserving info.  \n",
    "  *Algorithms*: PCA, t-SNE.  \n",
    "- **Association**: Discovering rules in data (e.g., \"Customers who buy X also buy Y\").  \n",
    "  *Algorithms*: Apriori, FP-Growth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- Customer segmentation based on purchase history.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Semi-Supervised Learning**  \n",
    "**Definition**: Uses a mix of **small labeled data + large unlabeled data**.  \n",
    "**Use Case**: When labeling data is expensive/time-consuming.  \n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- Medical image analysis (few labeled scans + many unlabeled ones).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  \n",
    "**Definition**: Learns by **trial-and-error** using rewards/penalties.  \n",
    "**Components**:  \n",
    "- **Agent**: Learns from actions (e.g., a robot).  \n",
    "- **Environment**: Where the agent operates.  \n",
    "- **Reward Signal**: Feedback for actions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:  \n",
    "- Game-playing AI (AlphaGo), self-driving cars.  \n",
    "*Algorithms*: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Self-Supervised Learning**  \n",
    "**Definition**: A subset of unsupervised learning where the **data generates its own labels**.  \n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- Predicting missing words in a sentence (used in models like BERT).  \n",
