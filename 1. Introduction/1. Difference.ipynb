    "the differences between **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Data Science**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  \n",
    "   - **Definition**: AI is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence (e.g., reasoning, problem-solving, perception, decision-making).  \n",
    "   - **Examples**: Chatbots, self-driving cars, game-playing AI (like AlphaGo), and virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa).  \n",
    "   - **Subsets**: Includes **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Rule-Based Systems, and Expert Systems**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Machine Learning (ML)**  \n",
    "   - **Definition**: A subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.  \n",
    "   - **Key Idea**: Uses statistical models to improve performance over time with more data.  \n",
    "   - **Examples**: Spam detection, recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon), fraud detection.  \n",
    "   - **Types**:  \n",
    "     - **Supervised Learning** (labeled data, e.g., classification & regression).  \n",
    "     - **Unsupervised Learning** (unlabeled data, e.g., clustering).  \n",
    "     - **Reinforcement Learning** (learning by rewards/punishments, e.g., robotics).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Deep Learning (DL)**  \n",
    "   - **Definition**: A specialized subset of ML that uses **neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks)** to model complex patterns.  \n",
    "   - **Key Idea**: Mimics the human brain’s structure to process large amounts of unstructured data (images, text, speech).  \n",
    "   - **Examples**: Image recognition (CNNs), speech recognition (RNNs/LSTMs), generative AI (GPT, DALL-E).  \n",
    "   - **Requires**: Large datasets and high computational power (GPUs/TPUs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Data Science**  \n",
    "   - **Definition**: A multidisciplinary field that extracts insights from structured and unstructured data using **statistics, programming, and domain knowledge**.  \n",
    "   - **Key Components**:  \n",
    "     - Data collection & cleaning.  \n",
    "     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  \n",
    "     - Statistical modeling & ML for predictions.  \n",
    "     - Visualization & storytelling.  \n",
    "   - **Tools**: Python/R, SQL, Pandas, Tableau, Hadoop/Spark.  \n",
    "   - **Relation to AI/ML**: Data Science often **uses ML/AI techniques** but also includes non-AI methods (e.g., traditional analytics).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Relationships**  \n",
    "- **AI ⊃ ML ⊃ DL** (Deep Learning is a type of ML, which is a subset of AI).  \n",
    "- **Data Science** uses **AI/ML/DL** but also includes broader data analysis techniques.  \n"
